This is a project to scrape data from professional darts competitions from [dartsdata.com](https://live.dartsdata.com/). We can use the API that is called from the website to retrieve data from all matches on a specific date. It will output a csv file for each match.

To run this, clone the repo and edit the functions that run at the bottom of `darts_scraper.py`
